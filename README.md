# caesarcipher
This program breaks any text encrypted with a caesar cipher, by analyzing frequency scores of letters and comparing it to the frequency scores of letters in the English language (score values can be changed for other languages).

The example encrypted text is from the 1st Chapter of A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens.
